This is a practice of skills learnt from classes taken at RAIN. 
The 'Churn dataset' was given in class.
This repo comprises Data analysis, Data Preprocessing, Predictive Modelling, and Evaluation.
More actions will be performed in order to improve the predictive power of the model, as I acquire more skills to do so.
Feel free to pull requests.
